# Pyber Ridesharing written analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this anaysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. This summary will help us gain a better understanding of the ride-sharing data among the different city types. In addition, we created a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type to better vizualize these disparities and improve the Pyber app.

The highest total fare by city type is for Urban cities.

## Summary
### Three business recommendations
Based on my analysis of the three city types, my first recommendation is that the number of rural drivers has to increase to meet the demand. Second, as the number of drivers in rural cities increases, then the average fare per driver will decrease, stabilizing the average fare per driver for rural cities. Finally, as these changes happen, the average Fare per ride for rural cities should go down and reduce the disparity between the city types.
